                <h2>Problem Statement: Delay Avoidance</h2>
                <p>
                    People need a better way to accurately track how long it will take them to get to class. 
                    This includes expected stoplight and crosswalk traffic.

                <p>
                    In our affinity diagram for an app to help people get to class on time, we found our categories to be the design of the app,
                    how the app helps users to navigate, what delays and other circumstances the app would notify you of, 
                    personal preference as to route and timing of arrival, and customization as to the user's needs of the app.

                <p>
                    My individual persona is a made up person named Jake Seabrook. 
                    His quote is, "I want to work normally and have a good life in spite of my disability."

                <p>
                   The storyboard I chose to make describes my persona, Jake, using the app to find a route to work with less hills and no stairs.
